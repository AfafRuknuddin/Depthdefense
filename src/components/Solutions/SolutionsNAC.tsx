                    Network Access Control (NAC) is a security solution that
                    helps organizations control access to their network. NAC
                    solutions use various techniques to authenticate and
                    authorize users and devices that connect to a network,
                    ensuring that only authorized parties are granted access.
                    This can include methods such as checking the userâ€™s
                    credentials, assessing the health and compliance of
                    connected devices, and requiring the installation of
                    security software before allowing access. NAC solutions can
                    help prevent unauthorized or malicious access to a network
                    and reduce the risk of security breaches.
