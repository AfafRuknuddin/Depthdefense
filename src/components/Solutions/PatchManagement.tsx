                    Patch management is the process of identifying, acquiring,
                    testing, and installing software updates (patches) to
                    address security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and
                    other bugs in operating systems, applications, and firmware.
                    Patch management helps to maintain the security, stability,
                    and reliability of computer systems and networks by ensuring
                    that all software components are up-to-date with the latest
                    patches released by vendors. This can include both operating
                    system patches as well as patches for individual
                    applications. Effective patch management requires proper
                    planning, testing, and change control procedures to minimize
                    risks to the organization.

                    Vulnerability management is the process of identifying,
                    evaluating, prioritizing, and mitigating security
                    vulnerabilities in an organization’s IT infrastructure. This
                    includes finding vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and
                    configuration settings that could be exploited by cyber
                    attackers to breach an organization’s security.
                    Vulnerability management also involves implementing
                    effective and timely responses to identified
                    vulnerabilities, including patching, updating software, and
                    applying security measures to prevent exploitation. The goal
                    of vulnerability management is to minimize risk to the
                    organization by reducing the potential for successful cyber
                    attacks
